# 🧠 Finite Element Model-Based Neural Twin for Structural Dynamics and SHM

A deep learning–assisted **structural health monitoring (SHM)** framework that integrates **Finite Element (FE) simulations** and **Neural Twin architectures** to predict, analyze, and visualize the dynamic behavior of structures under various loading and environmental conditions.

## 📘 Overview

This project bridges the gap between traditional **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)** and **data-driven learning** through a hybrid *Neural Twin* model.  
It enables high-fidelity digital twin generation, vibration response prediction, and damage localization — using simulation-generated data for training and real-world motion data for validation.
